TODO:
* URLs are case sensitive
* Move RightPanel out of __layout(note: gave up because its hard to make it both fixed, growable and flex aligned outside of __layout)
* offer option to export progress to json file and load it
* comment answers: questions that ask "where do you see binary in your life?" and displays github comments
* prefetch pages on hover?
* time stamps
* support linking to a video using native html5 tags opposed to only youtube.
* random generated questions require writing a .svelte file?
* remember scroll position on refresh?
* analytics??
* cannot add line numbers because of prismjs highlighting
* allow youtube video tags everywhere instead of just the front matter

Minimize file size:
* run all images through png quant 
* minify json

Notes:
JSON MAY NOT PRESERVE ORDERING, WORKS FOR NOW BUT FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED
Line numbers on highlighting is broken

3 levels of understanding problem set? level 3 is maximum inference?

# the first rule is that you must not fool yourself
