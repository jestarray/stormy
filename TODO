TODO:
* add explanations to exercise problems when wrong answer is submitted
* Consider moving RightPanel out of layout and make it more flexible(skipping for now because its better to have more complex scripting functionality split into a seperate page)
* offer option to export progress to json file and load it
* comment answers for open ended questions: "what do you think of (x)?" and displays github comments
* time stamps
* support linking to a video using native html5 tags opposed to only youtube.
* remember scroll position on refresh?
* analytics??
* cannot add line numbers because of prismjs highlighting
* allow youtube video tags everywhere instead of just the front matter
* look into pure offline mode using hash based routing. Just fire up the html file without needing a http server
* URLs are case sensitive
* auditory and more visual feedback when answer is wrong in exercise panel

Minimize file size:
* run all images through png quant 
* minify json

Notes:
JSON MAY NOT PRESERVE ORDERING, WORKS FOR NOW BUT FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED
Line numbers on highlighting is broken

3 levels of understanding problem set? level 3 is maximum inference?

# the first rule is that you must not fool yourself
